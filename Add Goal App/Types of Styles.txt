This project contains few different aproaches of adding style to the components


And then we'll dive into two popular approaches

for scoping styles to components,

so for setting up styles

such that they only affect the component

and are not added as global styles.

We'll have a look at STYLED COMPONENTS,

which is a third-party library, a very popular one,

which allows us to set up pre-styled components

with their own scoped styles.

And we'll have a look at a concept called CSS MODULES.

And you will learn what these different approaches

are all about, how you do work with them,

and how you could add them to your next project.

Now, to dive into styling, we need a demo project,

and to mix things up I got a brand new project here.
